# skarpeiveckan

Creating a website with NodeJS backed up by a MongoDB database. I scrape match-data from svenskbandy.se and store it in MongoDB. Upon user opening website, send the games and show the ones being played this week at my home town bandy arena, Skarpe Nord. 

----------TODO-----------

NEXT: Scrape game-arena data. This is difficult because its generated by svenskbandy.se after pressing a particular button for every game.

~~Scrape all divisions. Sort into MongoDB properly. 

Properly render game-tables so that it looks somewhat decent and all relevant data is shown.

Include team pictures in tables. This requires all team logos from all divisions relevant to Skarpe Nord. This will probably require manual work. 

Create a better week system. 

Create system that tracks amount of visits

Properly design the website. Crucial part. Make just as simple for mobile as desktop. 

Deploy?
